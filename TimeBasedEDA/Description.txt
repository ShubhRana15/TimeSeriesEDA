The aim of the project is to analyze a time series data for various insights. The data contains monthly sales record of a retail brand with stores across USA for 2019 as 12 separate files. For ease of use I have combined all the files into one single csv file which I am using in the script below. Our intent is to analyze and deduce the following information using EDA.

Average number of orders per month/daily/hourly
Average Revenue per month
Hourly/Daily/Monthly Order volume
Hourly/Monthly/Daily Order Value Distribution
